    <b>Challenge:</b> Plant Power has had very little problems with complaints from their customers as they run a very polished operation that keeps customers happy and returning. This is because the system they use makes sure workers are responsible for taking care of any customer complaint whenever it comes up. This is a breathtaking method compared to other chain restaurants where customers have to trudge through the chain of command till someone might be able to help you. This problem solving method makes the customer feel they are being personally attended to. But without the ability to keep track of their complaints company wide they may have discrepancies in how situations are handled in each restaurant. Which is not good when attending to customers and one feels another person got better treatment than they did.

    <b>Solution:</b>To make sure their workers and managers are able to log complains that the customers have they should at least start by having a spreadsheet that can list out the date, time, and issue the customer had. Then it would have the response the manager had so that if another manager encounters a similar situation they have something to compare themselves to for how they should act to help the customer. The next thing they should implement is a system to complain directly to the company from the website. As of right now the only way to get in contact with the company is in person or through social media. For some people in person causes them to get anxious about what their complaint is which may stop them from saying what went wrong. Causing the company from missing out on many many valid complaints that are useful for a company to grow. The next point that the only way people have to get in touch with the company is through social media makes people have to put down plant power in order to get in touch with them. This fact just overall hurts the brand image with the ability to possibly help someone with their problem. So to alleviate these problems they should have a specific section in their contact us page of their website dedicated for complaints and problems. This allows the customer to know where to direct their energy without the fear of being bounced around and not being helped. This also gives them a specific place to keep track of all the complaints that have come in. Having a way to keep track of the complaints is very important for a growing company so that they are able to keep track and find out what they need to change and keep during their meetings and make their business that much better than the competition.
