    <b>Challenge: </b>Plant power prides itself on serving their customers with healthy and tasty food while also trying to help the environment. Their food is made entirely without the use of animal products, GMO’s, or artificial ingredients because they believe, and have discovered, that one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gasses is the production of dairy and meat products. In all of their stores they try to maintain a strict policy of not wasting any food either. Their policy stresses to their employees to use all of the food in any way they can. However, in some cases there is just nothing that can be done and some food will be thrown away or wasted in some other form. Plant Power tries to implement a log for whenever food is wasted but obviously it is hard to keep track of all the food that is wasted everyday. Plant Power needs to install a different system to try and save food because ultimately it will save them money and help the environment that much more.

    <b>Solution: </b>Across the United States in the restaurant industry there is an average of around 11.4 million tons of food being wasted annually. This accumulates to a grand total of about $25 billion wasted annually. By investing in certain strategies and systems, plant power could save a lot more money if they are able to significantly reduce the amount of food being wasted throughout their chain of restaurants. Some easy strategies that Plant Power could try an implement could be creating new menus to repurpose food prep trim and overproduction while also reducing the number of ingredients used within their meals. Another approach could be to offer portion choices on certain items on the menu to encourage customers to only order the amount of food they will eat. Furthermore, Plant Power could track food waste by weighing, recording, and observing the the amount of wasted food in their bins or counting loads hauled. Once they have collected this data they could begin to make purchasing decisions based on inventory logs and historic sales. They can negotiate with their suppliers for deals that best fit their customer volume and then enact some form of feedback mechanism for their chefs to adjust the details of the supply. A system that they could use is LeanPath’s tracking. It uses analytic platforms that could potentially account for food waste in certain restaurants. Since 2016, when they released the software, some companies and restaurants have been able to reduce their food waste by 44%. If Plant Power could utilize some of these aspects and systems, then they could potentially save a lot of money and also continue to help the environment.
