    <b>Challenge:</b> The company Plant Power is failing to market itself to its fullest potential. As of right now, the company markets itself primarily through social media platforms showing images of their food. Their aim is to attract clients in and
    around university campuses by word of mouth. Plant Power is the initial force of marketing, but soon afterwards, the clientele will market themselves as representatives for the business. An extension of a previous problem arises right here, negative marketing.
    Strategies such as this only work if everything positively aligns for the organization. Opportunities for negative attention become potential problems here. Without mass amounts of attention, negative attention receives a much higher weight for a business such as Plant Power.

    <b>Solution:</b>A long-term goal of Plant Power is to extend itself to different university campuses all across the nation. Social media is an excellent form of marketing/advertising in this day-to-day technological age. Although this is true, posting pictures is not enough. Promotions need to happen for businesses,
    especially those within the food industry. Competing in a perfectly competitive marketplace, vendors seek to one up one another. The emphasis of Plant Power is selling fresh plant-based products that accommodate nearly every diet. Promotions should be held monthly or quarterly to increase attraction. Days that demonstrate
    a surge in sales oftentimes show continual increases in sales over time. Rewards/loyalty programs are another strong option to increase retention of customers. Both of these ideas place a strong emphasis on Plant Powerâ€™s aim to use their customers as forms of marketing. Advertisements on applications seem to always attract
    attention from new consumers. Partnering with different up and coming technologically savvy individuals will allow Plant Power to pair their promotions with user engagement. I strongly recommend this business to seek out a university student to become a marketing lead. The newest and most up-to-date marketing techniques will
    then be implemented into outreach.
